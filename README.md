#  Book Search Engine
The Book Search Engine project is designed to provide avid readers with a powerful tool to discover new books and keep track of their reading interests. Users can easily search for books by entering a search term, and the application will display relevant search results with each book's title, author, description, image, and a link to the book on Google Books.

## Challenge Overview
The challenge is to create a user-friendly book search engine application that allows avid readers to search for new books, view detailed book information, and manage a personalized list of books they are interested in. The application must provide a seamless experience for both logged-in and non-logged-in users, with functionalities to search for books, sign up, log in, save books to a personal list, and remove books from that list.

1.React: For building the user interface.
2. Node.js: To handle server-side logic.
3. Express: To set up the server and handle routes.
4. MongoDB: For the database to store user data and saved books.
5. GraphQL: For the API to handle data fetching and mutations.
6. JWT: For user authentication and authorization.
